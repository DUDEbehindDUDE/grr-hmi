# HMI (Human-Machine Interface)

The **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)** is designed to facilitate interaction between human operators and the robot. This layer will provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling robot functions, enabling efficient and accurate commands to be sent to the robot.

## Goal 🏆️

The goal of this project is to create an intuitive and reliable interface that allows for straightforward control and monitoring of the robot’s functions. By standardizing communication methods and display components, the HMI aims to simplify operator interaction with the robot, ensuring flexibility for both current and future use cases.

## Overview ℹ️

This repository currently uses **React** to build a responsive and dynamic interface. React will be used to display input options and such on the touchscreen on the robot. In the future, this should also allow for being able to connect to the robot via a tablet or laptop to get more advanced information. As development progresses, additional tools such as ROS and Flask are probably going to be integrated to allow for direct communication with the robot.
